# k210
## Introduction

This module features the **K210** as its AI processing core. Users can switch between multiple built-in AI functions by toggling the rotary knob at the top. On the right side, a **Grove interface** is provided, which can be configured via a graphical user interface to support either I²C or UART communication protocols. It enables connection to various external peripherals and is fully compatible with LEGO SPIKE and EV3 systems, offering excellent compatibility and ease of use. Additionally, the module leverages the **ESP32-S3** to communicate with the K210, enabling stable and efficient Wi-Fi image transmission.

## Onboard Core Chips

### ● K210

The Kendryte K210 is a high-performance, low-power RISC-V processor designed for edge computing and AI vision tasks. It integrates dual 64-bit cores, a KPU neural network accelerator, an image signal processor (ISP), and audio processing modules, making it capable of completing image acquisition and AI inference locally. In this product, the K210 handles image processing from the camera and performs tasks such as color recognition, object tracking, QR code recognition, and face detection. It can also emulate the SPIKE color sensor protocol to communicate with external host controllers.

### ● ESP32-S3

The ESP32-S3, developed by Espressif Systems, is a high-performance Wi-Fi + BLE dual-mode SoC featuring a dual-core Xtensa LX7 architecture with a clock speed up to 240 MHz and rich peripheral interfaces. In this module, the ESP32-S3 communicates with the K210 via UART and is specifically responsible for streaming image data over Wi-Fi, enabling wireless image transmission within a local area network.

* **I²C Mode**: `GND`, `VCC`, `SDA`, `SCL` (from left to right)
* **UART Mode**: `GND`, `VCC`, `RX`, `TX` (from left to right)

---

## Communication Overview

The module supports the following communication methods:

* `I²C` (with selectable addresses)
* `UART` (standard serial configuration)
* `SPIKE Emulation Protocol` (compatible with LEGO SPIKE and EV3)

Users can choose the communication mode via the settings interface. After selecting, click “Exit” to reboot the device and apply the new configuration.

---

### I²C Communication

#### Device Addresses

Three selectable I²C addresses are available:

* `0x24`
* `0x25`
* `0x26`

These can be configured through the settings menu. After applying changes, the device will automatically reboot to avoid conflicts on shared I²C buses.

#### Protocol Details

Please refer to the \[`registed`] document for the complete I²C communication protocol specification.

---

### UART Communication

#### Serial Settings

* **Baud Rate**: 115200
* **Data Bits**: 8
* **Parity**: None
* **Stop Bits**: 1
* **Flow Control**: None

Ensure that the host controller or PC uses the same configuration for successful communication.

#### Protocol Details

Please refer to the \[`serial_communication`] document for details on the UART protocol and command format.

---

### SPIKE Compatibility Mode

When the communication protocol is switched to **SPIKE Mode**, the module emulates a SPIKE color sensor. The K210 generates corresponding color, reflection, and RGB values based on the recognition results from each AI mode.

For detailed value mappings, refer to the \[`k210_spike`] document to accurately decode sensor data in different AI modes.

## Feature Overview

------

###  UI Behavior

- If **no interaction** (button press, UART/I²C communication) is detected for more than **5 seconds**, the bottom status bar will automatically be hidden.
- All button operations **only take effect when the status bar is visible**. If the bar is hidden, the first button press will only bring it up without triggering any action.
- In the settings interface, after making changes, the user must click **Exit** to apply them. Some settings require a **device reboot** upon exiting to take effect.

------

### Color Detection

- A rectangular area is shown at the center of the screen.
- The module calculates the **average RGB values** of the pixels within this area.
- The displayed color represents the average color value, ideal for standardized recognition.

------

### Color Blob Tracking

- Press the button to enter color selection mode.
- Toggle left/right to choose from six predefined colors (**Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Black, White**).
- Selecting the last option allows the user to aim the central box at any color in view, then press the button again to **lock that color for tracking**.

------

- If no input is detected within 5 seconds after finishing the first class, the device will **automatically switch to recognition**.
- Upon reaching the max number of classes, pressing the button or waiting 5 seconds will **enter recognition mode**.
- During recognition, **mode switching is disabled**. **Long-press the button** to reset training data and exit.
