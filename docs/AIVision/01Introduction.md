# Introduction
![](img/I1.png)



This module adopts the K210 as its AI processing core. Users can switch between multiple built-in AI functions by toggling the dial wheel on the top. On the right side, it is equipped with a Grove interface, which can be configured via a graphical interface to support communication protocols (I²C or UART). It allows connection to various peripherals and is compatible with LEGO SPIKE and EV3 systems, providing high compatibility and ease of use. In addition, the module communicates with the K210 through an ESP32-S3, enabling stable and efficient Wi-Fi image transmission.
