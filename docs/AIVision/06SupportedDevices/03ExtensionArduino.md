# Extension - Arduino
## Introduction
The Arduino library is written in C++ and communicates with the K210 AI Vision Sensor via the I²C interface.

Based on this library, users can develop programs that achieve higher efficiency and richer functionalities. This tutorial mainly introduces usage through the `Wire` I²C library, but it is not limited to `Wire`. You may also refer to the `override` example to implement usage in other environments.
